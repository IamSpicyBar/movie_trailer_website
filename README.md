# movie_trailer_website
Movie trailer website project for Udecity
## What are these files for?
**fresh_tomatoes.py** is a file to implement the website, directly downloaded from Udacity.  
**media.py** defines the class 'movie', which I use in this project.  
**entertainment_center.py** creates 6 instances for 6 movies, and makes the website.  
## How to run this project?
Put all files in the same directory, and run **entertainment_center.py**.
## Recent problems (Solved)
The first position in the second roll on the website is blank.
